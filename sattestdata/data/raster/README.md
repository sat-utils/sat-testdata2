## sat-testdata raster data

Each sample of data is in it's own directory containing one or more bands, metadata, and a README file.

Directories of data are named by keywords, separated by underscores, that describe the scene characteristics.

- clear: no clouds
- cloudy: lots of clouds
- full: no missing data areas (nodata)
- subset: a piece of the larger scene
