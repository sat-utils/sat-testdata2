## sat-testdata vector data

Each sample of data is in it's own directory containing one or more files, and a README containing information on the data.

Directories of data are named by keywords, separated by underscores, that describe the scene characteristics.

- polygons/lines/points: the type of geometries
- urban/forest/water/...: the class of pixels, if appropriate
